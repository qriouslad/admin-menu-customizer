Customize the order of the admin menu and optionally change menu item titles or hide some items.

## Description

**Admin Menu Customizer** allows you to:
* Change the order of menu items.
* Change the title of menu items added by active plugins and theme.
* Hide menu items on page load, with a "Show All" toggle to reveal them on click.

This is useful to keep your admin menu tidy when your site grows more complex and have more menu items than can fit on the screen. It also helps you and site editors, authors and contributors focus on the most relevant menu items, e.g. for managing content.
